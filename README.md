### Deep Learning Charity Funding Network

The goal of this analysis was to create and test a deep learning model that predicts the success of charity applications. By analyzing the data, the model tries to find patterns that show what factors make an application more likely to succeed. The process includes preparing the data, building and training the model, and testing how well it works. Finally, the analysis provides insights and suggestions on how to make the model more accurate and effective.

In terms of data preprocessing, the target variable used for the model is **IS_SUCCESSFUL**, which tells us whether an application was successful. The main features used in the model include **APPLICATION_TYPE**, **AFFILIATION**, **CLASSIFICATION**, **USE_CASE**, **ORGANIZATION**, **STATUS**, **INCOME_AMT**, **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS**, and **ASK_AMT**. Two columns, **EIN** and **NAME**, were removed from the dataset as they are identifiers and did not contribute to predicting the success of an application. These variables were unnecessary for building the model.

For compiling, training, and evaluating the model, I started with 2 hidden layers but eventually settled on 4 layers, as this provided the best results. The first three hidden layers each had 6 units, while the final hidden layer had 8 units. The **ReLU** activation function was used for the hidden layers because it processes data efficiently and avoids the problem of vanishing gradients. The output layer used the **Sigmoid** activation function, which is ideal for binary classification tasks like this one, where the goal is to predict whether an application will be successful or not. After training the model, I was able to achieve 79% accuracy and a 77% loss on my third attempt. While I met the target accuracy, the high loss value indicates that the model's predictions were still somewhat inaccurate, suggesting that there’s room for improvement.

To improve the model's performance, I experimented with adding more hidden layers, gradually increasing the number until I reached the desired goal of over 75% accuracy. However, despite meeting the accuracy target, the high loss value indicates that the model is not fully optimized and could still benefit from further adjustments.

In summary, while the deep learning model achieved the goal of over 75% accuracy, the high loss value (77%) means it is not yet reliable enough for practical use in predicting charity funding success. The model’s performance could be improved, and thus, I wouldn’t recommend using it for charity funding decisions without further refinements.

As an alternative, I recommend using a **Random Forest** model to solve this classification problem. Random Forests are better at handling both categorical and numerical data without needing a lot of additional preprocessing. They can also help identify the most important features in the dataset, which makes it easier to focus on the most relevant data. Furthermore, Random Forests are less likely to overfit the data compared to individual decision trees, which means they perform better on new, unseen data. They are also easier to interpret, and they can provide more accurate predictions while simplifying the process of working with different types of data. Using a Random Forest model could improve the overall accuracy and reliability of the model.
